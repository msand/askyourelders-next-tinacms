# About Barbora Xu and the history of the project

Originally from the Czech Republic, Barbora has been living in Taiwan and Finland, studying traditional singing styles, as well as string instruments-zithers, such as the Chinese guzheng and the Finnish kantele. With her various solo and collaborative projects, she has pioneered a new sound in the guzheng and kantele music and re-contextualised traditional playing forms with experimental, improvised, minimalistic and electronic music.

Barbora has graduated from the University of Turku as an expert on Chinese culture, currently attending the Global Music Programme, at the Sibelius Academy - University of the Arts, Helsinki. She is a former fellow of the “Making Tracks”, an international artist collaboration project, promoting social engagement and environmental awareness. Barbora has performed around the world at venues such as the King’s Place in London, the Megaron Concert Hall in Greece or the Helsinki Musiikkitalo and Turku Concert Hall in Finland. Her work has gained visibility by media outlets such as the YLE, MTV3, the International Radio Taiwan, the Czech National Radio, amongst others. Bringing unfailingly strong and imaginative performance; Barbora is a musical unicorn that will take you to her own cinematic universe.

# How did this project start?

In the academic year 2015-16, I did fieldwork research on the Bunun indigenous music in Taiwan. Specifically, this research was based on more than 200 in-depth interviews concerning the past and present lifestyle and use of the traditionals songs. Majority of the interviewees were elderly people, because they were the ones who still sang the traditional songs, they remembered Japanese occupation of Taiwan and the nationalistic regime of the Kuomindang. They were the last witnesses of the old ways.

One of the local singers-grandmothers, Isul, took me under ‘her wing’ and taught me various Bunun songs. Isul also shared a tune that she learned from her mother, a simple story advising on sowing seeds. Upon leaving the mountains, I made an arrangement of this song to offer as a thank you to Isul and this was the beginning of this project.

You can see the first video of the song here:

English translation of the lyrics:

**Tupa Tina**

My mother told me:

At the time you will be sowing millet,

Put a few beans in your pocket.

And while sowing the millet seeds,

Throw these beans next to the edge of the field,

Sow them in a row.

You can eat corn,

You can eat straight beens,

You can eat long beans,

You can eat sweet red potatoes.

The people who know how to work well,

Have plenty to eat.

This virtual ‘library’ is open to artists from all disciplines to draw inspiration from.

This project is a non-profit initiative aiming to generate meaningful moments and reduce the potential suffering of the elders caused by their long-term isolation. Moreover, the _Ask Your Elders_ project aims to provide value to the generations to come by recording the wisdom of our elders.
