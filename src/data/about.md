# Ask Your Elders 

_Ask Your Elders_ is an initiative aiming to connect the people who had lived a full life with the young generations. It is a way to connect with our loved ones that we might not be able to visit during the quarantine time and a way to do something meaningful. 

## How to take part in the project?

1. Pick up your phone
2. Prepare paper and a pen, a notepad or a recording device
3. Call your elders
4. Ask them important questions and permission to share the answers with the humanity
5. Post your stories to our website or post them publicly to your social media profile adding #AskYourElders 
6. Congratulations! You are contributing to the universal databank of human wisdom, experience and knowledge.

We are offering you a couple of questions that might trigger particularly meaningful answers:

* What was your life like when you were my age?
* What do you wish to have known when you were young?
* What are the things young people may regret in the future?
* What questions should we answer for ourselves in order to lead a happier life?
* How have you overcame the most difficult periods of your life?
* What were the important pieces of advice you got from your elders/parents/family?
* Do you have any motto or most important value to live by?

Remember, the stories might be meant for you, or for all of us. Ask your elder for a permission to share their story. Even if it is not to be shared with the world, you can still cherish it in your own memories and thoughts.
