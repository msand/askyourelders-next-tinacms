_Ask Your Elders_ is a project connecting the people who have lived a full life with the young generations. In times of isolation, it is a way to approach our loved ones and create something meaningful. With your help, the elders are able to participate in modern ways of sharing and even give rise to creation of art. Letâ€™s do it together!

In the _Ask Your Elders_ concert 11.6.2020, Barbora Silhanova (Barbora Xu) from the Global Music of the SibA, premieres newly composed pieces drawing from stories of the older generation posted with #askyourelders by the larger public before 5.6.2020.

How to take part in the project? It is easy!

1. Pick up your phone

2. Prepare a notebook or any kind of recording device

   It is important to be able to take notes when you are asking deep questions. The answers may be more complex than we expect.

3. Call your elders!

   You can call your grandparents, parents, distant relatives or older friends... They have a lot more to share than we might ever imagine!

4. Ask your elders

   Ask them about things you are pondering about, ask their advice, ask them to tell you a story. Ask them anything or just let them speak and listen deeply. If you want to record the call, ask them for permission in advance.

   We are offering you a couple of questions that might trigger particularly meaningful answers:

   - What was your life like when you were my age?
   - What do you wish to have known when you were young?
   - What are the things young people may regret in the future?
   - What questions should we answer for ourselves in order to lead a happier life?
   - How have you overcome the most difficult periods of your life?
   - What were the important pieces of advice you got from your elders/parents/family?
   - Do you have any motto or most important value to live by?

5. Post the story, thought, observation

   You can post on Instagram or other social media using #askyourelders. You can also submit your post directly on [www.askyourelders.org](http://www.askyourelders.org)

   What should the format of your post be? You can share one sentence or a whole essay, the format is free. You can also share a poem, a song, a picture, be creative! It is important to remember that the stories might be meant only for you, or for all of us. Ask your elder for permission to share their personal story. Even if it was not to be shared with the world, you can still cherish it in your own memories and thoughts.

6. Congratulations, you have contributed to the open library of the wisdom of our elders!

   The posts shared with #askyourelders before 8th of June 2020 will be an inspiration for new pieces premiering at the Feel Helsinki Ask Your Elders Live Stream Concert. Posts shared after 8th of June may be an inspiration for future artistic projects.
