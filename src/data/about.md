_Ask Your Elders_ is a project connecting the people who have lived a full life with the young generations. In times of isolation, it is a way to approach our loved ones and create something meaningful. With your help, the elders are able to participate in the modern way of sharing and even give birth to an actual art creation. Let’s do it together!

In the _Ask Your Elders_ concert 11.6.2020, Barbora Silhanova (Barbora Xu) from the Global Music of the SibA, premieres newly composed pieces drawing from stories of the older generation posted with #askyourelders by the larger public  before 3.6.2020. 

How to take part in the project? It is easy!



1. Pick up your phone

2. Prepare a notebook or any kind of recording device

    It is important to be able to take notes when you are asking deep questions. The answers may be more complex than we expect.

3. Call your elders!

    You can call your grandparents, parents, distant relatives or older friends... They have a lot more to share than we might ever imagine!

4. Ask your elders 

    Ask them about things you are pondering about, ask their advice, ask them to tell you a story. Ask them anything or just let them speak and listen deeply. If you want to record the call, ask them for permission in advance.

    We are offering you a couple of questions that might trigger particularly meaningful answers:

    *   What was your life like when you were my age?
    *   What do you wish to have known when you were young?
    *   What are the things young people may regret in the future?
    *   What questions should we answer for ourselves in order to lead a happier life?
    *   How have you overcome the most difficult periods of your life?
    *   What were the important pieces of advice you got from your elders/parents/family?
    *   Do you have any motto or most important value to live by?

5. Post the story, thought, observation

    You can post on Instagram or other social media using #askyourelders. You can also submit your post directly on [www.askyourelders.org](http://www.askyourelders.org) 

    What should the format of your post be? You can share one sentence or a whole essay, the format is free. You can also share a poem, a song, a picture, be creative! It is important to remember that the stories might be meant only for you, or for all of us. Ask your elder for permission to share their personal story. Even if it was not to be shared with the world, you can still cherish it in your own memories and thoughts. 

6. Congratulations, you have contributed to the open library of the wisdom of our elders!

    The posts shared with #askyourelders before 8th of June 2020 will be an inspiration for new pieces premiering at the Feel Helsinki Ask Your Elders Live Stream Concert. Posts shared after 8th of June may be an inspiration for future artistic projects.

# How did this project start?

In the academic year 2015-16, I did fieldwork research on the Bunun indigenous music in Taiwan. Specifically, this research was based on more than 200 in-depth interviews concerning the past and present lifestyle and use of the traditionals songs.  Majority of the interviewees were elderly people, because they were the ones who still sang the traditional songs, they remembered Japanese occupation of Taiwan and the nationalistic regime of the Kuomindang. They were the last witnesses of the old ways.

One of the local singers-grandmothers, Isul, took me under ‘her wing’ and taught me various Bunun songs. Isul also shared a tune that she learned from her mother, a simple story advising on sowing seeds. Upon leaving the mountains, I made an arrangement of this song to offer as a thank you to Isul and this was the beginning of this project.

You can see the first video of the song here:

English translation of the lyrics:

**Tupa Tina**

My mother told me:

At the time you will be sowing millet,

Put a few beans in your pocket.

And while sowing the millet seeds,

Throw these beans next to the edge of the field,

Sow them in a row.

You can eat corn,

You can eat straight beens,

You can eat long beans,

You can eat sweet red potatoes.

The people who know how to work well,

Have plenty to eat.



This virtual ‘library’ is open to artists from all disciplines to draw inspiration from.

This project is a non-profit initiative aiming to generate meaningful moments and reduce the potential suffering of the elders caused by their long-term isolation. Moreover, the _Ask Your Elders_ project aims to provide value to the generations to come by recording the wisdom of our elders.
