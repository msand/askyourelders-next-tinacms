What is the best way to admire beauty?\r\nWhat is some advice to live with no regret?\r\nHow can we deal with anger?  \r\nWhat is the best way to open the heart?\r\nHow can we best overcome challenges,  be joyful, at peace and in union with all situations?\r\n\r\nMother: \r\nIâ€™m not feeling very wise. Enjoy this brief miracle of life. Be quick to forgive yourself and others. Spend time with nature using all your senses. Respect others. Be thankful.\r\nSon: Thank you.
