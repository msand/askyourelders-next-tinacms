When the regime ended young and eager democrats asked her \"How could you do this for all those years working for the regime?\" She answered \"blood is blood\". After the regime change she could not get another job because of the position she did before (working in a prison hospotal).","elder":"My Grandma","name":"Vnouczek","email":"c4103f122d27677c9db144cae1394a66","date":1590061054}
